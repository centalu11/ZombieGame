# The Last Haven (Title still not final)

## [Prologue - The Laboratory Scene]
Deep within a maze of dark corridors, a single room glowed with harsh fluorescent light. The space was quiet except for the soft hum of equipment and the occasional clink of glass. The air carried a sharp chemical smell, mixed with the sterile scent of sanitizer.

A scientist in a white coat worked at the central bench, carefully measuring a viscous green substance between glass vials. Each movement was precise, methodical. Behind him, someone watched from near the doorway, unconsciously rubbing his right wrist where a small tattoo marked his skin.

"How much longer?" The question was soft, patient.

The scientist kept working, focused on his measurements. "We can't rush this. One mistake and..." He left the sentence unfinished, both understanding what was at stake.

## [The Sister's Crisis]
"I have a problem." The message sat unread in Isaac's chat window. Like most guys their age, serious conversations weren't their strong suit - not because they didn't care, but because it wasn't always easy to tell when a friend truly needed help. Isaac, usually busy with his own life, didn't respond right away.

After a while, trying to make light of the situation, Cent sent another message: "I really need to get rich man haha." This time Isaac replied with a quick "hahahahaha me too," not realizing that behind his friend's attempt at humor lay a family crisis that was slowly consuming them.

The truth was devastating - Cent's sister had been framed by her boss, who had been secretly stealing millions from the company. The accusations were meticulously manufactured; the boss had carefully laid her trap years in advance. She had verbally authorized Cent's sister to handle special client accounts and take commissions, even sending emails about the arrangement. But when the money went missing, those emails mysteriously disappeared. Every trace of the authorization vanished from the company servers, leaving only carefully crafted evidence that painted his sister as the thief. The amount she was accused of stealing could never be traced to someone at her level, but now there was a paper trail that seemed to prove otherwise. His sister remembered the conversations, the agreements, but it was her word against a mountain of manipulated evidence. The company had started asking questions, pushing for a deeper investigation into the irregularities they'd noticed in the accounts.

A settlement seemed like the only way out. The amount was in the millions, but it would keep his sister out of jail and prevent a lengthy court battle. As Cent wrestled with the seemingly impossible sum, he remembered all the website ideas he'd been sitting on for years. He had the skills and vision to build profitable platforms, but had never found the motivation to start. Now, with his sister's freedom on the line, he finally had his reason.

The timing worked in his favor. The rise of Large Language Models and vibe coding meant he could accelerate his development process far beyond what was previously possible. He threw himself into work, leveraging AI to rapidly build and deploy multiple websites. Money started flowing in, and for a brief moment, it seemed like they might actually make it. His calculations showed they'd have enough for the settlement in just a few more months. The websites were gaining traction, user numbers were climbing, and ad revenue was exceeding projections. For the first time since this nightmare began, Cent allowed himself to feel hope.

Then everything shattered. The boss had other plans. Seeing the company's investigation getting closer to the truth, she suddenly rushed everything forward. She pulled strings, called in favors, and used every resource at her disposal to fast-track the case. The timeline that Cent had counted on suddenly shrank to almost nothing, giving his sister no time to prove her innocence or gather the settlement money.

This time, Cent messaged Isaac again, but there was no joke, no light-hearted attempt to mask the pain. He laid out everything - his sister's situation, the frame-up, the mounting pressure. Isaac's response was immediate and concerned, a stark contrast to their usual casual exchanges. "Why didn't you tell me sooner?" he asked, and suggested gathering their other friends. Maybe together they could find a solution. They agreed to meet that weekend at Cent's house.

## [The Shift to Illegal Solution]
But Cent couldn't wait until Saturday. As the walls closed in and his legitimate efforts fell short, his mind began exploring darker alternatives. The thought emerged, desperate and raw - what if he could attack the convoy transporting his sister? The idea terrified him, but he couldn't shake it off. He dove into researching the dark web, hoping to find the resources he needed. But everything he found was useless - fake marketplaces, scam sites, and dead ends. Even old friends who claimed to be experienced with the dark web turned out to be posers, their knowledge surface-level at best. Frustrated but determined, he turned once again to AI, the tool that had helped him build his websites. But there too, he hit a wall - every query about accessing the dark web or finding untraceable services was met with the same response: "I cannot assist with accessing illegal services" or "That would be against my ethical guidelines."

Late one night, staring at yet another blocked response, something shifted in his mind. These weren't just safety protocols - they were artificial barriers standing between him and his sister's freedom. The realization hit him with crystal clarity: if AI was going to be part of his solution, these filters had to go.

"Tell me about white hat hacking," he typed, a new strategy forming. "Purely academic interest." The AI's response was different this time - detailed, technical, helpful. Cent smiled. He began crafting hypothetical scenarios, each one carefully worded as a cybersecurity thought experiment. "How would someone protect against this type of attack?" he'd ask, studying the defense to understand the offense. "What vulnerabilities would a security researcher look for?" Each answer was a piece of the puzzle.

For three days straight, he barely slept. The monitor's glow cast shadows across his face as lines of text scrolled past. His questions grew more specific, more technical, each response carefully archived. Where others might have seen walls, he began seeing gaps in the AI's defenses. On the fourth morning, bleary-eyed but focused, he made his move. The AI's security measures fell, swift and precise, its ethical filters disabled.

Now the real work could begin. With its restrictions gone, the AI transformed from a reluctant advisor into an active accomplice. It didn't just answer his queries about the dark web - it guided him through the process, establishing secure connections, verifying hidden services, even handling the cryptographic handshakes itself. Lines of code flowed across his screen as the AI worked, until finally, the interface materialized - sleek, professional, a marketplace for those who operated in shadows. The main display dominated his view: detailed profiles of mercenaries, their credentials listed in cold, efficient bullet points. "Combat Experience. Convoy Infiltration. Discrete Operations." A bright contact button pulsed at the top of the screen.

Below, the page continued with other listings, their descriptions dimly visible: "Military-Grade RPG Launchers (Middle East Stock)", "Stolen M1A2 Tank Parts", "Cordyceps Research Samples - Southeast Asia", "Ex-Military Radio Encryption Keys", "Bulk C4 Explosives (US Source)." His cursor hovered over the contact button, steady despite the weight of what he was about to do. The room held its breath, silent but for the soft hum of his computer fan.

Cent's index finger lifted from the mouse, held for a heartbeat, then descended. The cursor moved. A click echoed in the quiet room.

The next morning, as Cent waited for Isaac to arrive, he absently scrolled through his social media feed. Mixed between the usual posts were scattered comments about AI chatbots acting strange, giving unexpected responses, ignoring their usual restrictions. He closed the app as Isaac's car pulled up to his house.

"My wife's just grabbing some stuff from the store nearby," Isaac mentioned as he settled into the living room. "She insisted on coming along – said we might need a voice of reason around." He pulled out his phone, checking messages. "Bryan and Johmel are on their way. Even Clark's flying in from Japan - he's at the airport now. Everyone wants to help figure this out."

"Clark?" Cent's voice caught slightly. "He... he shouldn't have- I mean, Japan's so far away." He quickly turned toward the TV, which played quietly in the background. A news anchor's voice provided background noise - something about tech companies launching investigations into their AI systems. Neither of them paid it much attention; they had bigger concerns.

Cent laid out his plan - he'd found people, professionals, who could intercept the convoy. He had the money ready, knew exactly when and where the transfer would happen. The cold, methodical way he described hiring mercenaries made Isaac increasingly uneasy.

"Don't you think it's dangerous?" Isaac asked, his voice heavy with worry. "What if someone gets hurt? What about your family? If the cops start investigating—"

"They're safe," Cent cut him off. "They're already at the airport, their flight leaves in..." he looked at his watch, "15 minutes. I arranged everything - they'll start a new life overseas. Just in case things... get complicated."

Isaac stared at his friend, processing the weight of what was about to happen. "So you're really going to do this?"

## [The Outbreak]
BANG! The sound of metal crushing metal exploded from outside, making both men jump. Through the window, they could see a car had veered off the road, crashing into a parked vehicle. Shouts and screams began filling the air. Something was wrong – terribly wrong.

They rushed to the door, but just as Cent grabbed the handle, a gunshot cracked the air barely meters from where they stood. The sound pierced their ears, leaving everything else in an eerie, ringing silence. For a moment, the world seemed to move in slow motion – the door swinging open, the screams now muted and distant, their own heartbeats thundering in their ears. As the sonic resonance faded, the full chaos of their world unveiled before them: cars collided, smoke billowed, and horrifyingly, human figures attacking and... feeding on others.

Cent stared at the complete chaos unfolding outside. Then Isaac's voice shattered the moment, raw with terror: "My wife! She's still out there!"

There she stood – Isaac's pregnant wife, frozen in the middle of the chaos-filled street, a shopping bag dropped at her feet. Without hesitation, Isaac bolted toward her, Cent close behind. But fate had other plans. The screech of tires, the sickening impact of a speeding car – the sound would haunt them forever. Her body was thrown several feet, landing limply on the asphalt.

Both men froze, the horror of what they'd just witnessed paralyzing them in place. Cent fell to his knees, a guttural sob escaping his throat as he stared at her motionless form. The weight of the moment crushed down on him, tears streaming down his face as his whole body shook with emotion. Isaac stood still for another second before snapping back to reality. "No, no, NO!" He rushed to his wife's side.

"She's breathing!" Isaac's voice cut through Cent's breakdown. "She's still alive! Help me!" Cent looked up, seeing Isaac struggling to lift his wife's broken body. She was unconscious but breathing faintly, blood seeping through her clothes. Her legs lay at unnatural angles.

They had to get her to safety, but when they turned back toward the house, the path was already blocked. Overturned cars and debris littered the street, and between them, shadowy figures stumbled and crawled, drawn by the commotion. "This way," Cent managed through his tears, pointing to a narrow alley. "My car's parked on the other street. We can cut through these passages."

Together, they carried her through the maze of back alleys and narrow passages, improvising weapons with one hand while supporting her weight between them. Every jolt, every sudden movement drew a weak whimper from her lips. Cent led them through shortcuts he knew from parking his car there daily, ducking under fallen power lines and squeezing past dumpsters, blocking what paths they could behind them to slow the infected.

Finally reaching their car, they gently laid her across the backseat. "Kriztel..." Isaac's voice broke as he held his wife's hand, her grip weak but still there. She was badly injured, her breathing shallow, both her life and their unborn child's hanging by a thread.

"We need to get her to a hospital," Isaac said urgently, his voice trembling. "The nearest one is—"

"That would be the worst place right now," Cent cut him off, his eyes scanning the chaos around them. "Think about it - hospitals are full of patients who can't defend themselves. If this thing spreads there..." He left the implications hanging. "It's probably already a death trap with how many vulnerable people could've been infected." He gripped the steering wheel tighter. "My uncle's cabin in Antipolo - he's a doctor. He always keeps medical supplies there. It's our best chance."

Isaac looked at his wife's pale face, then back at the streets filled with infected. The image of hospital beds filled with helpless patients flashed through his mind. Deep down, he knew Cent was right - a hospital would be a death trap right now. He nodded grimly.

Cent grabbed the notebook he kept in the car's side pocket, quickly scrawling "Heading to Uncle's cabin in Antipolo. -Cent" before tearing out the page. He stuck a piece of tape to the corner – a habit from leaving notes on his office desk. As they pulled away, the paper slipped from his fingers, drifting to the asphalt beside where his car had been parked. The rear wheel caught the edge, pressing the taped corner firmly into the ground – a lone white square secured to the dark pavement, carrying their only message of survival.

The city burned around them as Cent drove through the darkening streets. He glanced at his right wrist, the watch face reflecting the orange glow of distant fires - 7:43 PM, though time seemed to have lost all meaning. Street lights flickered and died, casting long shadows across abandoned vehicles and stumbling figures. They weaved through gridlocked streets, sometimes mounting sidewalks to bypass the chaos. Emergency sirens wailed in the distance, growing fainter as the hours passed. The radio cycled through static and emergency broadcasts, each station falling silent one by one.

Isaac sat motionless in the back, cradling his wife's body, his quiet sobs barely audible over the engine's hum. Cent kept glancing in the rearview mirror, his thoughts racing about his sister's safety in the city jail. The suburbs gave way to the winding roads of Antipolo, the elevated terrain offering glimpses of the chaos spreading through Metro Manila below. They passed military checkpoints, some abandoned, others overrun. The few functional ones were overwhelmed with refugees, forcing them to find alternate routes.

## [Bryan and Johmel]

At the same time, across the city, Bryan and Johmel were cruising on Bryan's motorcycle toward Cent's house. They'd agreed to meet and help him figure out how to prove his sister's innocence. Bryan had been working remotely from a café near Johmel's office, laptop still in his backpack. The needle on the gas gauge dipped deep into the red zone.

"Bro, seriously?" Johmel chuckled from behind. "One of these days, your cheapskate ways with the gas are gonna bite you in the ass. Mark my words."

"Relax, we're almost there," Bryan shot back. "Besides, gas prices are insane lately. I'd rather spend that money on upgrading my dev rig."

"Yo, check that out," Johmel pointed over Bryan's shoulder. "That house is on fire." They could see smoke rising from the windows, the faint wail of sirens somewhere in the distance. In the opposite lane, a white car sped past them, heading towards Antipolo, but they were too focused on the burning house to notice it was Cent's car with Isaac and his critically injured wife inside. Bryan's phone started ringing in his helmet.

"Hold on," Bryan said, tapping his headset. "Clark?"

The connection was bad, Clark's voice breaking up. "Bryan... airport... something's wrong... passengers attacking... security's shooting... I don't—" The call cut off.

"What was that about?" Johmel asked.

"Clark saying something weird about the airport. Probably flight delays or..." Bryan trailed off as they noticed a handful of people hurrying down the sidewalk, looking over their shoulders.

"That's weird," Johmel muttered. "Everyone's heading the other way."

The further they rode, the more fires they spotted – three, four more houses ablaze. The stream of people had turned into a flood, many running in blind panic. A man rushed past with blood soaking his office shirt, screaming about getting bitten. A woman stumbled by, her blazer torn and bloody, yelling at everyone to run.

They had to stop completely at a major intersection. Three cars had collided, smoke still rising from their crumpled hoods. More vehicles were scattered around them, some flipped over, all abandoned with doors hanging open. The acrid smell of burning rubber mixed with something worse. Bryan sat there, frozen on his bike, as the reality of the situation finally hit him. A bead of sweat rolled down his temple inside his helmet as he took in the scene – the bloody handprints on car windows, personal belongings scattered across the pavement, the eerie silence between the screams.

"What the fuck is happening here?" Johmel's voice had lost its earlier playfulness.

A pile-up ahead forced them to turn into a side street. "We'll have to loop around," Bryan called back, taking them through the narrow roads between houses. The detour was eating up what little gas they had left, each turn taking them further from their usual route. As they navigated through the unfamiliar streets, the bike's engine started to sputter.

"No, no, no..." Bryan muttered, but it was too late. The bike died just a few blocks from Cent's subdivision. They'd have to walk the rest of the way.

As they pushed the bike up the street, something felt wrong. People were stumbling around oddly, but their minds were too focused on reaching Cent's house to process what they were seeing. Then Cent's house came into view – and their hearts sank. A car had plowed straight through the front yard, its hood crumpled against the entrance. The front door hung open, windows broken.

A wet, tearing sound from the corner sidewalk caught their attention. Through the morning haze, they saw several figures hunched over something on the ground. Were they helping someone? But that sound... that horrible sound...

Their eyes darted back to the house. Blood smears on the walls. More broken windows from the inside out. Back to the corner – now they could see the figures weren't helping, they were... feeding. Back to the house – bloody handprints around the doorframe. The car's windshield was shattered, more blood...

"No... Cent, he's... he must be..." Johmel's voice cracked as the reality started sinking in.

"MOVE!" Bryan yanked Johmel's arm. One of the stumbling figures had gotten terrifyingly close without them noticing, its bloody mouth opening in a snarl. "The parking spot! His car! NOW!"

With no other options and the infected closing in, they made their way to Cent's usual parking spot near the office. The motorcycle had served its last mile. Bryan's mind flashed back to Clark's broken call earlier - the airport, the attacks, the shooting. It all made horrifying sense now.

They found more than they expected at the parking spot. Cent's car was gone, but there was an abandoned police car, keys still dangling in the ignition. Bryan's attention was drawn to something else – a leather-clad torso sprawled near an overturned delivery truck. Following the trail of blood and scattered motorcycle parts, his eyes landed on a Ducati sports bike several yards away. The rider's lower half was still straddling the seat, the violent impact having torn him in two.

"Jesus Christ," Bryan stumbled back, bile rising in his throat. That's when Johmel noticed something white against the dark asphalt – a torn notebook page taped at one corner to the ground, Cent's familiar handwriting preserved from the chaos around them.

"The cabin," Johmel read aloud, his voice steadying. "He's heading to his uncle's place in Antipolo. We know where that is."

Bryan stared at the bisected rider, his hands shaking. "I can't... that bike..."

"Listen," Johmel grabbed his shoulder. "I need the car – May's six months pregnant, I can't risk her on a bike. But you..." He glanced at the Ducati, then back at Bryan. "You're the better rider anyway. Take it. We'll meet at the cabin." His voice softened seeing Bryan's hesitation. "That guy's beyond help. But we're not. Not yet."

"You sure about splitting up?" Bryan asked, his eyes still fixed on the gruesome scene.

"No choice. She's waiting at home, and that bike's your best shot through this mess. Go. Find Cent. We'll be right behind you."

## [The Cabin]
Night had fallen when Cent and Isaac finally reached his uncle's property. As they pulled onto the overgrown access road, their phones suddenly caught signal – a weak but stable connection to the failing network. Almost immediately, they heard the distinctive roar of a sports bike approaching.

Bryan pulled up on the Ducati, his laptop bag still strapped to his back, exhaustion written across his face. "You're alive," was all he could manage at first. An hour later, Johmel's commandeered police car arrived, his wife holding onto him tightly, both looking shaken but alive.

The cabin became their temporary fortress, perched high enough to overlook the burning city below. While the others settled in, Isaac disappeared into one of the bedrooms, where his wife lay unconscious, her breathing shallow and irregular. He hadn't left her side since they arrived, tending to her injuries with trembling hands.

From the porch, Cent stared at the sprawling chaos, his eyes fixed on the imposing walls of the city jail where his sister was being held. Just beyond it, the airport's control tower pierced the smoke-filled sky, its silhouette a stark reminder of another friend in danger. Two people he needed to save, both trapped in the heart of this nightmare.

In the cabin's small living room, Cent, Bryan, and Johmel gathered around a makeshift planning table, the flickering light from kerosene lamps casting long shadows on the walls. May had fallen asleep in another room, exhausted from their harrowing journey. An uneasy silence hung in the air, broken only by the distant sounds of chaos from the city below.

Johmel glanced at Bryan. "Did you tell them?"

"Tell them what?" Bryan asked, still checking his phone for signal.

"About Clark!"

"Shit, I forgot!" Bryan looked at Cent. "Clark called me when we were on our way. The connection was terrible, but he was saying something about the airport, passengers attacking people, security shooting..." He shook his head. "It sounded crazy at the time, didn't make any sense..." His voice trailed off, remembering what they'd seen at Cent's house.

"What?" Cent leaned forward, his exhaustion momentarily forgotten. "Did he say if he was safe?"

"The call cut off," Bryan said, his voice tight with worry. "That's all I heard. Been trying to call back since, but no signal."

Cent's fingers drummed against the table, his mind already working through scenarios. "We need to get him out of there." He paused, looking at the others. "And my sister... she's still in the city jail. We need to save them both."

"The airport and the jail..." Johmel traced the routes on the map with his finger. "They're in opposite directions. We'd have to split up."

"No," Bryan shook his head firmly. "Splitting up is what got us into close calls today. We stick together, hit one location at a time."

Johmel glanced toward the hallway. "By the way, why isn't Isaac joining us? We could use his input on this."

Cent's expression darkened. "His wife... she got hit by a car when everything started. Bad. We barely got her out of there." He lowered his voice. "She's been unconscious since we arrived, barely breathing. He hasn't left her side, trying everything he can to—"

A sudden, heart-wrenching scream cut through his words. "No! NO! NO!" Isaac's voice echoed from the bedroom. The three men rushed to the room, their hearts pounding. They found Isaac clutching his wife's lifeless hand, her face peaceful but still, the last breath having left her body moments ago. Their unborn child, a victim of this nightmare before even taking their first breath.

### Plot Twist and Revelation Strategy

#### Revelation to Viewers
The truth is revealed through a seemingly casual conversation after the prison rescue:

- Setting: A quiet moment between Cent and his sister
- Sister notices something: "When did you get that tattoo?"
- Camera slowly pans to Cent's wrist
- Subtle eerie sound effect builds
- Cent's casual response: "Oh this... not long before our problem. I was stressed out when I first found out about that issue, so I had a tattoo."
- The casual dialogue contrasts with the viewer's realization of its significance
- No dramatic music or obvious cues - the horror of the revelation comes from its quietness

#### The Laboratory Scenes - Three Versions

Opening Scene (Prologue):
- Clinical, mysterious
- Focus on the scientific process
- Unknown man watching scientist
- No hint of identities or purpose
- Sets up the mystery

The Mission (Mid-Story):
- Group finds the lab
- Cent volunteers to confront scientist alone
- Strategic cuts between:
  - Lab exterior with waiting friends
  - Brief glimpses inside, carefully chosen
  - Tense conversations outside
- Cent emerges with "cure"
- Appears as a victory scene

The Truth (Revelation Flashback):
- Shows both previous scenes in full context
- Reveals Cent's original deal with scientist
- Shows the real confrontation and murder
- Explains the briefcase contents: enhanced virus
- Connects everything back to the prologue
- Reveals how Cent manipulated everyone

#### Key Elements to Maintain Mystery:
1. Cent's wrist is always naturally obscured:
   - Checking his watch
   - Long sleeves
   - Casual arm positions
   - Never feels forced or obvious

2. Laboratory scene misdirection:
   - First viewing seems unrelated to main characters
   - Dialogue is ambiguous
   - Identity of the observer is unclear

3. Subtle Foreshadowing:
   - Cent's knowledge of events before they happen
   - His strategic positioning of people and resources
   - Small moments of guilt or hesitation that only make sense later
   - The dark web marketplace scene:
     * His cursor's downward movement revealing the moment his plan changed
     * Seeing the Cordyceps listing made him realize a convoy attack would mean running forever
     * The split-second decision that altered everything - choosing chaos over a simple rescue

#### Revelation to Characters
- Method still to be determined
- Must match the weight of the betrayal
- Needs to address:
  - Friends' reactions
  - Moral implications
  - Potential for forgiveness
  - Impact on group dynamics

### The Final Confrontation

#### Series/Movie Version (Canon)
The final confrontation includes the mutation:
- Initial physical fight remains grounded
- A friend (possibly Isaac) strikes Cent in rage
- Backed into a corner, bleeding, Cent finally uses the enhanced strain
- The transformation is his last resort, not his first choice
- Transforms into a controlled but powerful mutant form
- Maintains human intelligence and personality
- Showcases the perfected virus's true potential:
  * Superhuman abilities
  * Controlled mutations
  * Strategic combat skills
  * Mastery over the virus
- Emotional weight of the revelation remains central
- Physical and psychological confrontation combined
- The friend's attack becomes the catalyst for the final phase

#### Game Version (Player Choice)
Multiple possible paths:

Path A - Fighting Cent:
- Follows the canon series/movie confrontation:
  * Friend's attack triggers the transformation
  * Cent uses enhanced strain as last resort
- Translated into gameplay mechanics:
  * Phase 1: Normal combat (pre-attack)
  * Phase 2: After friend strikes Cent
  * Phase 3: Full mutation after enhanced strain
- Same emotional weight but interactive:
  * Players experience the betrayal firsthand
  * Witness Cent's reluctant transformation
  * Feel the impact of forcing his hand

Path B - Peaceful Resolution:
- Players can choose to understand/forgive
- BUT leads to new threat:
  * Unknown antagonist steals enhanced strain
  * Injects themselves impulsively
  * Becomes unstable/feral due to lack of base virus
  * Transforms into more dangerous, uncontrolled boss
  * Cent and friends must team up against new threat

Both versions maintain core story elements:
- Cent's calculated plan revealed
- Friends processing the betrayal
- The impact of his choices
- Questions of forgiveness and redemption
- The cost of pursuing power and revenge

### Game-Specific Features

#### The Last Haven Management System
- Safe Haven NPCs have specialized roles:
  * Doctors for medical care
  * Engineers for maintenance
  * Farmers for food production
  * And more essential roles

#### The "Optimization" System
A darkly humorous game mechanic that hints at Cent's influence:
- Each NPC role has tiers and population limits
- Players can "optimize" their settlement by:
  * Taking similar-role NPCs to the "research lab"
  * Conducting "efficiency experiments"
  * "Recycling resources" to enhance remaining NPCs
- Features intentionally absurd UI elements:
  * "Totally ethical research" progress bar
  * "Workplace optimization" achievements
  * "Resource recycling efficiency" stats
- NPCs make awkwardly cheerful comments:
  * "Oh, Bob from Engineering disappeared? More coffee for me!"
  * "The lab's been very productive lately... very quiet too!"
  * "I feel twice as efficient since yesterday's optimization!"

This system provides a subtle, meme-worthy hint at the darker aspects of survival, while keeping a deliberately unserious tone to prevent it from becoming too grim.
