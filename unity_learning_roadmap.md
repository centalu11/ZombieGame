   - Study best practices guides

### Recommended YouTube Channels
1. Brackeys (archived but excellent tutorials)
2. Code Monkey (gameplay mechanics)
3. Jason Weimann (architecture and best practices)
4. Unity's official channel

### Practice Projects
1. **Week 1-2**: Simple movement and camera control
2. **Week 3-4**: Basic animation and character controller
3. **Week 5-6**: Interactive narrative scene
4. **Week 7-8**: Simple construction/building system

## Development Tips
1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with basic prototypes
   - Add features incrementally
   - Test frequently

2. **Version Control**
   - Use Git from the start
   - Regular commits
   - Maintain a development branch

3. **Asset Management**
   - Keep organized folder structure
   - Use meaningful naming conventions
   - Document asset dependencies

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test on target platform regularly
   - Profile performance early
   - Get feedback often

## Time Management
- Dedicate 2-3 hours daily
- Focus on one system at a time
- Build vertical slices
- Regular project backups
- Document your learning

## Next Steps After Roadmap
1. Join Unity communities
2. Participate in game jams
3. Share progress for feedback
4. Iterate based on learning
5. Scale up project complexity
