### Plot Twists and Revelations

#### The Main Twist - Cent's True Story
- Evolution of Cent's plan:
  1. Initial Rescue Plan:
     * Research on dark web for convoy attack
     * Realized they'd be fugitives forever
     * Needed a better solution
  
  2. The Apocalyptic Solution:
     * Inspired by games/movies where prisoners are forgotten
     * Plan to create chaos around jail area
     * Would allow sister's rescue without police pursuit
     * Planned for temporary outbreak (1-2 months)
     * Would hide in Antipolo safe haven
     * Originally intended to bring cure later

  3. The Development Process:
     * Shifted research from convoy attack to mind control
     * Found inspiration in cordyceps fungus (like TLOU)
     * Made progress but lacked scientific expertise
     * Found scientist on dark web with similar interests
     * Combined their skills:
       - Scientist's chemistry knowledge
       - Cent's AI expertise
     * Created virus but no cure yet
     * Scientist promised to develop cure (never happened)

#### The Laboratory Truth
Three versions of the same scene:
1. Prologue (Mystery):
   - Clinical and detached
   - Unknown observer
   - Sets up questions

2. Mid-Story Mission:
   - Group finds lab
   - Cent volunteers to go alone
   - Appears as straightforward mission
   - Seems like a victory

3. Final Revelation:
   - Shows Cent's true motives
   - Two objectives revealed:
     * Genuine hope for cure
     * Plan to silence scientist
   - Discovery of two virus strains:
     * "Perfected" virus for group
     * Hidden enhanced strain

#### The Final Confrontation

##### Series/Movie Version (Canon)
- Initial physical confrontation
- Friend (possibly Isaac) strikes Cent
- Cent uses enhanced strain as last resort
- Controlled but powerful mutation
- Maintains intelligence and personality
- Showcases virus's true potential

##### Game Version (Player Choice)
1. Combat Path:
   - Follows canon confrontation
   - Three-phase boss fight:
     * Normal combat
     * Post-friend's attack
     * Full mutation
   - Interactive emotional weight

2. Peaceful Path:
   - Option to understand/forgive
   - New threat emerges:
     * Unknown antagonist steals strain
     * Unstable transformation
     * More dangerous boss fight
     * Team up with Cent

### Story Structure Update

### The "Optimization" System
Dark humor mechanic hinting at story themes:

#### NPC Management

- Tier system with population limits
- "Research lab" for NPC improvements
- Intentionally absurd UI elements:
  * "Totally ethical research" progress bar
  * "Workplace optimization" achievements

#### Dark Humor Elements
- NPCs make meme-worthy comments:
  * "Oh, Bob from Engineering disappeared? More coffee for me!"
  * "The lab's been very productive lately... very quiet too!"
  * "I feel twice as efficient since yesterday's optimization!"
- Subtle hints at darker themes
- Maintains unserious tone
